# Facial emotion recognition system 

- This project focuses on building an AI-powered Facial Emotion Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Computer Vision techniques.
The system processes images captured from a camera, detects faces, and classifies different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust. 
- By leveraging Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV, the project demonstrates how deep learning can improve human-computer interaction (HCI) by enabling machines to understand and respond to human emotions.
